this assignment is a primer for 504/507

The name of the function is discount_calculation and the two inputs are price and age.
The price is the original price and the age is the age of the customer.
In the function, if the customer age is less than or equal to 12, there is a 25% discount, otherwise there is a 5% discount.
The discounted_price returns the final price after applying the discount to the original price.
In the example, the original price is 15 and the customer age 11, therefore a 25% discount is applied, and the final price will be 18.75.
